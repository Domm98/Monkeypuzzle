Monkeypuzzle version 1.5
-----------------------------
Monkeypuzzle was created as a web-based argument analysis tool, whereby a user may pick out pieces of text from a document and create an argument diagram containing the premise(s) and conclusion(s) of an argument.

This project aims to extend Monkeypuzzle to offer users the additional functionality of PDF analysis.

In this version, a user may run the application by opening the index.html file in a browser of their choice.

This version works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.
